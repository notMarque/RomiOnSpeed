# Design Goals
At the outset of this project we knew that we wanted to create a robot with differential swerve drive that was packaged as close to the same size as a Romi as possible. Due to these two broad constraints our design process started with creating a well-packaged swerve drive module and then nesting the other supporting components.
# Swerve Module
## Research 
When researching existing solutions for small form factor differential swerve drives we were able to find three main designs.
